HW 4
Created a directory that is of Users that have a Name, Email address and Password.  I will eventually add more schemas to this to create a blogging platform.  I essentially want to add this as a feature/link from my personal website as a blog.  
Therefore for a second schema I would like it to have:
Title(: ) Date(:date) Published(:boolean)
